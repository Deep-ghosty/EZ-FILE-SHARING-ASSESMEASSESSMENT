These test cases cover various scenarios including:

User signup and login
File upload (both valid and invalid file types)
File listing
File download
Authorization checks
Edge cases like ops users trying to download files


Deploying to a Production Environment:

Here's a more detailed plan for deploying the application to a production environment:
a. Set up the production database:

Use a managed database service like Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Google Cloud SQL.
Set up proper backup and recovery procedures.
Configure database security groups and access controls.

b. Containerize the application:

Create a Dockerfile (as provided in the previous response).
Build the Docker image and push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or Amazon ECR).

c. Set up a Kubernetes cluster:

Use a managed Kubernetes service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon EKS.
Create a Kubernetes deployment and service for your application.

d. Configure environment variables:

Use Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information like database credentials and JWT secret keys.

e. Set up a reverse proxy and SSL termination:

Use an ingress controller like Nginx Ingress Controller.
Configure SSL/TLS certificates using cert-manager and Let's Encrypt.

f. Implement logging and monitoring:

Use a logging solution like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Stackdriver.
Set up application performance monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

g. Implement CI/CD:

Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
Automate the build, test, and deployment process.

h. Set up auto-scaling:

Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in Kubernetes to automatically scale your application based on CPU or custom metrics.

i. Implement a CDN:

Use a content delivery network like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to serve static assets and improve global performance.

j. Set up regular security audits and updates:

Regularly update dependencies and the base Docker image.
Perform security scans on your codebase and Docker images.

Here's a basic Kubernetes deployment YAML file to get you started:
